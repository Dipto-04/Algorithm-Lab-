Ideal for academic reference, algorithm practice, and structured study workflows.


💻 CSE 232 – Algorithmic Problem Solving

Comprehensive Lab and Assignment Resource Collection

This repository contains a complete set of lab reports and assignment solutions developed for the course CSE 232 (Algorithms). Each problem is organized into a dedicated directory, providing the solution alongside the applied algorithm, pseudocode, and relevant conceptual explanations.

The objective of this repository is to present all coursework in a unified, professionally structured, and easily understandable format for both academic review and personal study.

🔑 Solution Framework

->  Every problem is placed in its own folder, and each folder includes:

->  A summary of the problem statement

->  The algorithmic approach used

->  Complete pseudocode

->  Additional notes, insights, or constraints

->  Implementation details where applicable

->  This ensures a consistent and well-organized documentation style across the repository.


📋 Problem Index

->  The table below lists the solved problems along with their platforms, algorithms, and directory paths.
